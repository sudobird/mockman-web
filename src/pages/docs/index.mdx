# Overview
This extension lets developers configure mock rules for all kinds of XHR requests. 
There's absolutely no change needed in the main project from where the calls are being made. 
Just configure the rules in the extension and refresh your app. 
Mocked apis will disappear from the network tab and will get logged in console.
